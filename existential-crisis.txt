Well, the API is just different in this language.
I can:
- Continue with the original concept, but use all string keys. This has obvious
  implications for how to use this from a typed language.
- Convert to keyword keys myself. Might be nice since I'd like to change
  everything to alists anyways. Easier to print, easier to work with. Hash
  tables seem wasteful.
- Come up with some method of using types in config. See, that might just work.
  - the yaml library has a notion of converters for this.
  - Then I could spread my concept past CL.
  - But this concept is really only meant for CL.

    Proposed:
    - A map from root config keys to types. This is just a type map such as what I'd
    need anyways. So I'd need a type map.
    - only top level keys can be specified on CLI or environment.
    - All CLI is yaml, except for strings, which are bare.
